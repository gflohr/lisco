Lisco wants to be a cross-platform chess UI in the future.

## Project setup

```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

## Current State

You can play a game against the Lozza chess engine. You can also play against Stockfish or tomitankChess (both included) but you have to modify the source code for it.
